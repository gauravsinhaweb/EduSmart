## Problems It Solves
In this pandemic, E-learning has proved a new and efficient method. For the past year, students stuck in their homes have attended numerous online classes. But these online classes are monotonous and concepts taught are not retained in their minds. The situation becomes worse when the subjects are practically based. Because of this, the actual visualization is crucial in subjects such as Aerospace, Biology, and many more. With this application, we focus on solving this problem. It utilizes 3D, Augmented reality to give real-life simulations or feels of various models and make the learning process more impactful and fascinating. With an interactive live feature, students can ask the teacher their doubts instantly and also discuss.
